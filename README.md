# DatabaseInterface
* **University of Denver Analytics Project (January 2023 - November 2023):**
  
  * Database Design: MS Access, ERD (Entity-Relationship Diagram)
  * Database Migration: MS Access to SQL Server (SSMS)
  * User Interface: C#, Visual Studio (connecting to SQL Server, data retrieval, visualization)
  * ETL Implementation (Optional): Automating data acquisition, transformation, and loading (SSIS or Python/R)
  * Data Visualization: Power BI/Power Pivot (interactive dashboards, insights)
 
  * **Highlights:** This project allowed me to showcase my proficiency in data management and visualization technologies. I developed valuable skills in data modeling, query writing, user interface design, and data analysis. Throughout the process, I honed my problem-solving, communication, time management, and critical thinking abilities. This experience provided me with a comprehensive understanding of the data management lifecycle, from design and implementation to visualization.
